# Mattermost Docker image builds

This repository contains source files for building Mattermost server Docker images. Differences from upstream:

* Reworked Dockerfile and re-created build script to build Mattermost directly from source,
* Removed custom entrypoint scripts, switched to a clean Postgres image,
* Changed image naming scheme to match the official builds,
* Reworked compose file to more closely match the [official](https://github.com/mattermost/docker),
  added personal version for running [in Podman on OpenWRT](https://github.com/DEREFERENC3D/mattermost-docker/tree/openwrt),
* Added personal patches (allow building non-development enterprise version without closed-source code ("`sourceavailable`") and license signature verification removal üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è)
* Reworked GitHub Actions workflows,
* Docker images are stored in GHCR (GitHub Packages) instead of Docker Hub.

# Building

The entire idea behind this repository is to run the build process in a container, fixing issues with build consistency, but also to create container images to run Mattermost in. It is however possible to only use Docker for building and export the resulting binaries for use outside of a container - as per [the Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/export/), simply add the `output` parameter. In the following example, binaries should be available in `./output/mattermost`.

```bash
$ # pick a version
$ export $(grep MATTERMOST_IMAGE_TAG= .env)  # e.g. MATTERMOST_IMAGE_TAG=v11.0.2
$ cd docker
$ docker build \
	-t mattermost-enterprise-edition:$MATTERMOST_IMAGE_TAG \
	# add if you wish to export compiled binaries
	-o output \
	# add to build for a different platform than your native one
	# e.g. build an image for ARM on an x86 PC
	# or build for multiple architectures:
	--platform=linux/amd64,linux/arm64
	. \
	--build-arg MATTERMOST_IMAGE_TAG=$MATTERMOST_IMAGE_TAG \
	# be sure to set something here, else this will be considered
	# a "development" build and some functionality will break
	# the following works for sh/bash/zsh and some other shells:
	--build-arg BUILD_NUMBER=$RANDOM
```

# Running

The app requires a database connection, which can be configured in [run.env](./run.env). You may want to run a DB server container, which is exactly what the compose file is for.

## Compose

Compose parameters (most importantly: the Mattermost version to build & run) are set in `.env`. Parameters for the containers themselves are set in `run.env`.

The Mattermost image should get built when running `compose up`. If you wish to use a prebuilt image instead, `docker pull` [it](https://github.com/DEREFERENC3D/mattermost-docker/pkgs/container/mattermost-docker%2Fmattermost-enterprise-edition) first.

## Standalone

Untested, but something like this should work. Make sure to pass `run.env` as the environment file to the container during creation.

```bash
$ # pick a version
$ export $(grep MATTERMOST_IMAGE_TAG= .env)  # e.g. MATTERMOST_IMAGE_TAG=v11.0.2
$ docker run \
	--name=mattermost \
	--env-file=run.env \
	# it's recommended to mount volumes in all user data locations, see the compose and .env files for all mounts
	-v volumes/app/mattermost/config:/mattermost/config:rw \
	-v [...] \
	[...] \
	mattermost-enterprise-edition:$MATTERMOST_IMAGE_TAG
```

# Updating

Should (ü§û) be as simple as changing the version in `.env` and rebuilding. The source code patches may need updating.

The repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow which should check for new versions on a schedule and do exactly that, adding a new branch, tag, and PR to `main`. Another workflow builds every tag starting with `v`, adding a new prebuilt image in GHCR for each new version.
